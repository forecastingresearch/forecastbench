  We publish as much data as we can in our <a href="https://github.com/forecastingresearch/forecastbench-datasets">datasets repository on GitHub<i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-up-right-from-square"></i></a>. Unfortunately, because of license restrictions, we're not able to publish information from the datasets from which we generate questions nor are we able to publish the market information pulled from forecasting websites.
  <br><br>
  However, there's still good stuff in our datasets repo! There you can find past <a href="https://github.com/forecastingresearch/forecastbench-datasets/tree/main/leaderboards">leaderboards <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-up-right-from-square"></i></a> (updated nightly), <a href="https://github.com/forecastingresearch/forecastbench-datasets/tree/main/datasets/question_sets">question sets <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-up-right-from-square"></i></a> (published every two weeks), and <a href="https://github.com/forecastingresearch/forecastbench-datasets/tree/main/datasets/resolution_sets">resolution sets <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-up-right-from-square"></i></a> (also updated nightly). Also of interest are the <a href="https://github.com/forecastingresearch/forecastbench-datasets/blob/main/datasets/forecast_sets/2024-07-21/2024-07-21.ForecastBench.human_super_individual.json">superforecaster <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-up-right-from-square"></i></a> and <a href="https://github.com/forecastingresearch/forecastbench-datasets/blob/main/datasets/forecast_sets/2024-07-21/2024-07-21.ForecastBench.human_public_individual.json">general public <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-up-right-from-square"></i></a> forecast sets from the survey round discussed in the <a href="/docs/#paper">paper</a>.

  The above repository is <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/forecastingresearch/forecastbench-datasets">mirrored to Hugging Face <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-up-right-from-square"></i></a> with the hopes of reaching as many users as possible.</p>
