      <p>We endeavor to work openly on ForecastBench. To that end, our code is public and we publish as much data as we can in our <a href="https://github.com/forecastingresearch/forecastbench-datasets">datasets repository on GitHub<i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-up-right-from-square"></i></a>. Larger files are provided for direct download on this site. If there's data you want that we don't provide, odds are it's a licensing issue. That said, feel free to contact us with any data request and we'll do our best to provide it.</p>
